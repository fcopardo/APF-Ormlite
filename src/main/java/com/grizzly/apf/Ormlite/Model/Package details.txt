This package contains every model intended to be stored in the database. Every class inside it must extend BaseModel<C>
in the following way:

public class BaseVersions extends BaseModel<Integer> {

    public static final String ID = "id";

    @DatabaseField(columnName = ID, id = true, generatedId = true)
    private int idField;

    public BaseVersions() {
        super(Integer.class);
    }

    public int getIdField() {
        return idField;
    }

    public void setIdField(int idField) {
        this.idField = idField;
    }

    @Override
    public Integer getId() {
        return getIdField();
    }

    @Override
    public void setId(Integer id) {
        setIdField(id);
    }

}

Where C represents the class that the ID field will have. That way the AdvancedDao class will be able to access the
ID field without any actions by us. Two methods are enforced by the BaseModel class, getId() and setId(C). They must
return the getter and setter of the ID field. Of course, if you name the ID field "id", you can use them directly.
